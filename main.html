        <h2>The Unglamorous Truth</h2>
        <p>Failed. A lot. Messy group projects, lost pitch competitions, misread people. But never gave up. That’s the twist. Always got up. Slightly pissed, slightly wiser.</p>

        <h2>My ‘Why’</h2>
        <p>My story is powered by a simple engine: <strong>make it count.</strong> For my parents. For my team. For myself. Success isn’t optional—it’s the plan.</p>
      </section>

      <section>

        <h2>Sleep is My Toxic Trait</h2>
